			  <p>Goals</p>
			<p>The goals for this testing was to find out if the participant understood what our website and brand is about and if she could find the buttons. This way, we could find out if the website is understandable and usable for our target group. We wanted to know if the participant knew what they could do with our website and what we could do for her, so that we know if the website would be understandable and helpful for expats living in The Netherlands who want to meet new people. This way, we know if our target group would make use of our website.</p>

<p>Methods</p>

<p>Participants</p>

<p>There were three participants in total. This participant matches with the target audience, because she is an expat who lives in The Netherlands. She is 35 years old and works in The Netherlands. She doesnât have a lot of Dutch friends and would like to meet new people in The Netherlands, but hasn't been brave enough to connect with Dutch people. </p>

<p>Setting </p>

The testing was done in the participantâs home in person, and the website was tested on my laptop. It was video recorded with my phone and a comfortable setting was created for the participants for the best and most natural responses.  

<p>Protocol</p> 

<p>The video of the testing was recorder on my phone. The instructions were: </p>

<ul> Find the mingle maker </ul>

<ul>Find where to crowdfund  </ul>

<ul>Find the page to get to know more about us </ul>

<p>I asked her: </p>

<ul>If she understood what the website is for exactly </ul>

<ul> If she liked the website </ul>

<ul>If she would use it </ul>

<ul> If she understood the logo </ul>

<p>Results </p>

<p>Positive: </p>

<p>She understood what the brand and website is about easily after being on the page for only 30 seconds. The homepage caught her attention, and she liked the colors. She thought the website looked nice and professional and she would use it, because she thinks it is valuable for her and would help her to meet new people in The Netherlands. She understood that the logo was people in a circle and thought it was fitting for the website and brand. She got that with the website you can mingle with other people. Understood quite fast that it is for internationals who want to mingle with Dutch people.  </p> 

<p> Mingle maker button was easy to find. She found it immediately.</p>  

<p>She found the about us page quite easily. She had to look for it for a few seconds and then found it on the top of the page.</p> 

<p> She found the support us button right away and understood that this button was for crowdfunding. </p>

<p> She thought the quantity of the text wasn't too much, and the textboxes made sense. It was a good amount of text.</p>

<p> Negative:</p> 

<p>She didn't have any negative points, only an improvement for the future. </p>

<p>Improvements: </p>

<p> If it was real, she would like to see more places to mingle to meet more people in The Netherlands, all over the country, because now there were only a few places. </p>

We wanted to know if the participant knew what they could do with our website and what we could do for her, so that we know if the website would be understandable and helpful for expats living in The Netherlands who want to meet new people. This way, we know if our target group would make use of our website. </p> 
<p>Methods:</p>
<p>Participants </p>
<p>There were three participants in total. This participant matches with the target audience, because she is an expat who lives in The Netherlands. She is 34 years old and works in The Netherlands quite fresh. She doesnât have a lot of Dutch contacts and still canât speak the language, she also struggles a bit with her English sometimes. She doesnât really feel home and is often very lonely.</p>

<p>Setting </p>
<p>The testing was done online via Zoom. I showed her the website online, and asked her questions about it. I recorded the Audio with my phone.</p>

<p>Protocol: </p>
<p>instructions were: </p>
			<ul>
Find the Mingle maker </ul>
<ul>Find the page to get to know more about us </ul>
<ul>Find out our values and what our brand stands for</ul>

<p>I asked her</p>
<ul>If she understood what the website is for exactly</ul>
<ul>If she liked the website</ul>
<ul>If she would use it</ul>
<ul>If she would pay for something</ul>
<ul>If she knows what our brand is about</ul>
<ul>If she understands the Mingle Maker</ul>
<ul>If she likes the colors and fonts</ul>

<p>She overall really liked the website and the design, it doesnât seem very commercial because of the playful fonts and the bright colors. She could navigate very easy through the page and find our values very quick. Also the Mingle Maker was easy to find, however she had troubles to identify the purpose of the Mingle-Maker. She didnât really understand that itâs a tool that you can use. She would pay for the events but not for the mingle-maker. Her overall impression of the brand was similar to what we want to convey however not 100% there yet. She was more focusing on the friendship and community aspect than on the bravery and getting out of your comfort zone aspect. She missed some links on the websites, because they were not functioning properly yet. 
She said in the end that she really likes the brand and our idea, she would definitely use it and follow all our social channels.</p>

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>Our brand is about connecting expats with the Dutch community and encouraging them to be more brave, so they can feel more at home and have a community in The Netherlands. By providing them places to go to and meet people, they can step out of their comfort zone and connect more with the Dutch people. Our message is that people make expats feel at home if they are brave enough to connect with them. This way expats can feel at home and have a community in their new country. To promote our brand, we created an Instagram account and a Facebook page. From the interviews we found that these are the most used social media channels by our target group. Instagram is one of the social media platform to engage and connect with your audience (Sean, 2023). Facebook is also one of the best social media platforms for a small business to connect with customers and for marketing a brand and product or service (Freedman, 2023).</p>

<ul>By April 10th 2023, we have 3 comments per post on our Facebook page. </ul>

 

<p>For our affect objectives, we wanted people to feel intrigued and brave enough to communicate with other people because of our Instagram and Facebook account. With our social media we created a community for expats so they could engage with our brand and other people. We made captions that are engaging and helpful for them to reach out to new people. We made posts that help expats to find a community, with places to go to, to meet new people in The Netherlands. We posted facts about The Netherlands and Dutch people, so that they feel more at home in The Netherlands and brave enough to reach out to Dutch people. </p>

<p>For our reach objectives, we wanted 150 people to see our Instagram account and 100 people to see our Facebook page. By following and engaging with other expat accounts and their followers, we got people to see our social media accounts. We made ourselves visible to the target group. </p> 

<p>For our response objective we wanted to have 100 followers on Instagram and 50 followers on Facebook. By following and engaging with other expat accounts and their followers, we got people to see our social media accounts. A lot of them followed us back. By posting helpful, engaging posts of good quality, we got people to follow us. </p> 

<p>We wanted to have 15 likes on Instagram and 8 likes on Facebook. By making appealing and good quality posts that have interesting and helpful information, like providing expats places they can meet people, we got the likes from our audience.</p>

<p>We wanted to have 1 comment per post on Instagram and 3 comments per post on Facebook. We engaged with our followers, by asking them questions in the captions. So, we encouraged people to comment and we received a few comments. </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>We learned that setting up a brand and social media campaign, takes a lot of effort. We had a good strategy and planning, so that made it easier to execute the plan. The reels on Instagram took a lot of time to make, but had a lot of views, so we learned that we could have made more reels and made more time for it. Some objectives were easy to realize, like how many people see our Instagram and Facebook account. We didnât expect to reach our reach objectives so fast. We actually got way over our desired reach, so we adapted our reach objectives to a higher number. Some objectives were difficult to reach. We wanted to have one comment per post on Instagram and three comments per post on Facebook and we only got two comments in total for each platform. We expected that there wouldnât be a lot of comments on Instagram, because even the big accounts barely have comments. But we didnât expect to barely have any, since we engaged well by asking them questions. We learned that the questions we asked were maybe too personal and therefore difficult to answer, we were too serious. When it comes to our followers and likes objectives, we almost reached them for Instagram, and we expected this. For Facebook we got way less followers than our desired reach. This is mostly because as a business account on Facebook, we canât follow private accounts, which made it harder to reach out and be reached. We almost reached our desired likes reach on Facebook and we expected this. We learned that setting realistic objectives, makes it easier to reach them.  </p>
          <h4 id="marketing-3" class="mt-4">Future Planning</h4>
          <p>It was a bit of a challenge for us to create consistency with all the elements, from the vision, to the value, to the logo and color palette, to make sure our brand and message is clear. We ended up focusing on âbraveryâ and âstepping out of your comfort zoneâ in all elements. We made an Instagram and Facebook account to promote our brand and build an audience and relationship with our target group. We gained a lot of followers on Instagram pretty fast, because we followed other expat accounts and their followers. In comparison, Facebook doesnÂ´t allow business accounts to follow private accounts, which made it harder to reach out and be reached. By creating a detailed and concise content calendar, it was easier for us to execute the social media campaign. We nearly reached most of the objectives, because we set realistic goals. </p> 

<p>What we would do in the future if the project would continue, is ask more specific and easy questionsâ¯in our captions on social media, because the questions we had were too personal and therefore hard to answer. By asking simpler and lighter questions on our social media posts, we would get more responses and we could interact with our audience on a more personal level. We could for example ask our followers to react to our post only with emojis. This is easy and fun to answer and so would probably get a lot more comments.</p> 

<p>We would do more reelsâ¯on Instagram, because our reels had a lot of views. Reels get more views and have a higher engagement rate. It creates more brand awareness and reaches a bigger audience (Firmanmara, 2023). So, it would help our brand to get seen by more people. Reels also take a lot more time, so we would adapt that in our media plan so we can take more time to make reels. </p>

 

<p>We would do quizzes on our social media and reveal the answer later. This way we can engage with our followers more in a fun way and have more engagement on our social media. If we reveal the answers to the quiz questions later on, they have to come back to our page, which will create more engagement with our account and brand. </p>

 

<p>We would do more funny, engaging posts and stories to build a more personal relationship with our followers. We could ask funny questions in stories like: âask your friend what song I look like.â We could shoot a: âTypical expats momentsâ and post this on social media. Our followers will relate to this, and this will create a stronger connection with us.</p> 

â¯ 

<p>We would check our engagement rates from our social media accounts more often to see what works better and what doesnât work. This way we know what gets the most views and engagement and we can focus on that more for better engagement results on our social media.</p>   
          <h4 id="marketing-4" class="mt-4">Professionalism</h4>
          <p>Present and organize below all social media/online activities of the campaign. Context and material are according to the brand style, image, and vision. Images on the site are of high-quality, readable, and properly designed.</p>
